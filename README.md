# RayFun-CUSTOMRAYFIELDSCRIPT
RayFun Is a Mutli User Script For roblox
where you can share temporary templates to the game.
THIS IS A CUSTOM MADE UI AND EVERYTHING THE "RayFunUI" WORKS AS THE SAME AS RAYFIELD BUT CUSTOM THEME.
Tutorial for the UI: find where it show where it says local = rayfield (URL), once you find it where the url is go to the RayFunUI file and view as raw then copy the url the that url spot done. INFO: this script is not being worked on at the moment. THIS COULD LEAD TO A A DISCONTINUATION OR A PERMANENT DELETED. you can take the 2 files and make a custom rayfield script for yourself or a public release. 
a tutorial on changing the long url script will be posted sometime soon. Thank you for tooning in. the RayDun UI url was included in update tutorial is still useful
